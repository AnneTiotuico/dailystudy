System design questions are intentionally open-ended so ask clarfication questions

## Step 1 - Understand the problem and establish design scope
 - ask for an example of how it works
 - ask for traffic volume
 - ask for constraints
 - clarify requirements
 - validate assumptions of key use cases and their functional requirements
 - main use cases; don't choose peripheral use cases like logging in/out

### Back of the enevlope estimation
*Make sure to walk through your assumptions and calculations with interviewer so both are on the same page*
- write operation per day
- write operation per second
- read to write ratio
- how many records/operations do we need to support over a given period of time
- storage requirments over given period of time
- start w total users / monthly active users, go down to daily active users
- peak reads per second
- peak writes per second

## Step 2: Propose high-level design and get buy-in

## Step 3: Design deep dive

## Step 4: Wrap up
